The current Homework Helper AI is a web application built using Next.js, which is designed to run in a web browser. To make it accessible on an iPhone, you can deploy it to a hosting service like Firebase Hosting, Vercel, or Netlify. Once deployed, users can access the app through Safari or any other web browser on their iPhones.

It's important to understand that this is different from creating a native iPhone app that you would download from the App Store. Native iPhone apps are built using technologies like Swift or Objective-C and require a different development process.

Unfortunately, automatically converting this Next.js web app to a native iPhone app is beyond the scope of this project and not something I can directly achieve. If you're interested in a native iPhone app, you would need to rebuild the application using native iOS development tools.
